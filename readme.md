# Optimization: Hill Climbing Mini project
Using c# we want to be able to find the global maxima from three different optimization problems. This is done using an iterative hill climber.

## The problems
* P1. 
* P2. 
* Reverse Ackley.

### P1
![P1][p1img]

### P2
![P2][p2img]

### Reverse Ackley
Reverse Ackley is the opposite of the following function:
![Ackley][p3img]
