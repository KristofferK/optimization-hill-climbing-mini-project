# Optimization: Hill Climbing Mini project
Using c# we want to be able to find the global maxima from three different optimization problems. This is done using an iterative hill climber.
All the problems for this project will be two dimensional.

## The problems
* P1. 
* P2. 
* Reverse Ackley.

### P1
![P1][p1img]

### P2
![P1 function][p1equation]
![P2][p2img]

### Reverse Ackley
Reverse Ackley is the opposite of the following function:
![Ackley][p3img]
